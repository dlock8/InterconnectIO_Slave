# First TestStation InterconnectIO SCPI Slave firmware

The complete FTS project is documented on a github website:  https://dlock8.github.io/FTS_Website/

On this deposit, we have the firmware used to create the Slave Pico load to control the interconnectIO board.

The hardware support for the firmware is on github location: https://github.com/dlock8/InterconnectIO_Board

The Slave Pico firmware enables the Raspberry Pi Pico to function as an I2C slave device, acting as a large Input/Output integrated circuit. 
The device receives a command byte, which specifies the action to be performed, followed by a data byte indicating where the action should be applied.

## Project setup

This project has been developped on raspberry pi 4 following installation instruction from this pdf [getting-started-with-pico_C.pdf](./documentation/getting-started-with-pico_C.pdf),  a copy of the pdf is located on the main folder.
Visual studio has been used for development and raspberry pi 4 for Pico debug.  

Based on https://github.com/vmilea/pico_i2c_slave. The pico_i2c_slave software has been added to enable the Raspberry Pi Pico to function as an I2C device.


The compilation is performed using Visual Studio and the important extension installed are:

* Cmake v0.0.17
* Cmake Tools v1.20.10
* Cortex-Debug v1.12.1
* debug-tracker-vscode v0.0.15
* Doxygen Documentation Generator v1.4.0
* Doxygen runner v1.8.0
* Github Pull Request v0.96.0
* Hex Editor v1.10.0
* MemoryView v0.0.25
* peripheral Viewer v1.4.6
* RTOS view v0.0.7
* C/C++ v1.21.6


I not sure if all extensions are required but is the one installed presently.


## Building

Build of this cmake project is performed with Visual Studio

## Development

* [`slave.c`](slave.c) is the main source file for the firmware.
* [`CMakeLists.txt`](CMakeLists.txt) contains build instructions for CMake, including how to build the SCPI library.
* [`pico_sdk_import.cmake`](pico_sdk_import.cmake) was (as usual) copied verbatim from the Pico SDK and allows CMake to interact with the SDKâ€™s functionality.

## Installation

* The Files slave.uf2 contains the firmware to be loaded on the Pico RP2040 board using USB cable and boot button.
* When software loaded, the Pico board should be installed on the location marked SLAVE_1, SLAVE_2 and SLAVE_3 on interconnectIO Board.
* On board Pico Led will flash slowly (heartbeat) on power ON.


## I2C Command supported

Pico i2C Slave mode Protocol

I2C Command is 2 bytes long:  Command_byte (1 byte) + Data (1 byte)

## I2C Communication Example

On these example, we use the i2c loopback mode 

    send_master(11, 22);     Command: 11, Data:22.   Set the GPIO 22 to 1 
    send_master(15, 0x02);   Command: 15, Data:0x02. Read the state of GPIO 02 
    send_master(85, 0xC0);   Command: 85, Data:0xC0. Read the Input pin 7 and 6 of Port 0 
    send_master(100, 0x00);  Command: 100, Data:0x00. Read the Device Status, Data 0x00 is mandatory but not used
